# dotfiles
This repo contains some dotfiles to ease the process of having a known
environment wherever I go.

Most of the stuff is "stolen"/inspired from others. What made me choose this
setup was looking at [Mitsuhiko's](https://github.com/mitsuhiko) dotfiles
repo.

My Vim plugins is handled with Vundle. Read more about it 
[here](http://www.charlietanksley.net/philtex/sane-vim-plugin-management/).

## Note to self
- Install [vcprompt](https://bitbucket.org/mitsuhiko/vcprompt)
